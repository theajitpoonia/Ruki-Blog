(1, 'Emmanuel', 'Ekpo', 'ChatGPT: A Threat To Higher Education?', 'general', 'Colleges and universities are at an inflection point, grappling with declining enrollments, soaring costs, growing popularity of educational alternatives, and a dwindling perceived value of a degree (all of which I examine in my latest book). The latest threat, if you believe the hype, is ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot from Silicon Valley startup OpenAI. Released on November 30, the large language model (LLM) software has been predicted to do away with higher education (as well as journalism, code writing, and even Google, according to Gmail developer Paul Buchheit, who tweeted on December 1 that the search engine “may be only a year or two away from total disruption”). As someone deeply familiar with the crises facing my institution and others, I can say with certainty that ChatGPT is more hype than harm—and it might even offer some help.\r\n\r\nA recent NPR story described ChatGPT as “thrill[ing] the Internet with its superhuman abilities to solve math problems, churn out college essays and write research papers.” “Education may never be the same,” bemoaned RealClearEducation. Current and former teachers see danger signs, including Beverly Pell, an advisor on technology for children and a former teacher, who opined, “This could be a danger in education, and it’s not good for kids.” Writing coach and founder of Crush the College Essay Peter Laffin warns that ChatGPT and other AI chatbots “will lead to a crisis in learning, forcing educators to rethink schooling entirely.”\r\n\r\nWhat these doomsayers fail to acknowledge is that programs and services for solving math problems and writing college essays and research papers already exist—and have for some time. The Photomath app, for example, has been around since 2014, with over 300M downloads, allowing students to take a picture of their math problems and get the answers. On the humanities side, papers have been for sale for years. Educators and admissions officers are not only well aware of these “services,” but have learned how to spot and work around them.\r\n\r\nOpenAI itself is working on solutions, according to TechCrunch. University of Texas, Austin computer science professor Scott Aaronson, a guest researcher at OpenAI, said the company is “studying hiding cryptographic signals, called watermarks, in ChatGPT results, so that they’ll be more easily identifiable by [anti-cheating software] companies like Turnitin.”\r\n\r\nOnce we move past the fear-mongering, it’s not difficult to imagine how LLM software can be used to enhance higher education. Ian Bogost, writing in The Atlantic, says “LLMs are surely not going to replace college or magazines or middle managers. But they do offer those and other domains a new instrument—that’s really the right word for it—with which to play with an unfathomable quantity of textual material.”\r\n\r\nWhat can we do with that new instrument? Imagine asking students in a composition course to edit and fact-check a Chatbot-generated essay. Bogost says because the software “is simply trained to generate words based on a given input...it does not have the ability to truly comprehend the meaning behind those words. This means that any responses it generates are likely to be shallow and lacking in depth and insight.” Students could be asked to critique those weaknesses, add insights of their own, and spot the inaccuracies that are all too common with ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nData scientist Teresa Kubacka decided to run her own experiment by asking ChatGPT about a “cycloidal inverted electromagnon,” which she made up. She tweeted the results, which not only sounded plausible, but were supported by citations—which turned out to be bogus. Kubacka says the experiment left her with “an intense feeling of uncanniness: I just experienced a parallel universe of plausibly sounding, non-existing phenomena, confidently supported by citations to non-existing research. Last time I felt this way when I attended a creationist lecture.”\r\n\r\nSam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI, has acknowledged the problem. “ChatGPT is incredibly limited, but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness,” Altman tweeted. “It\'s a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. it’s a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.” Indeed, users are warned that ChatGPT “may occasionally generate incorrect or misleading information.” That comes as no surprise to Stack Overflow, a coding resource forum that recently banned ChatGPT because it would not stop giving the wrong answers.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times’ Peter Coy says getting the most out of ChatGPT means acknowledging the limitations while “accentuating the positive.” He describes a YouTube video by web developer and product reviewer Jason Fleagle, who asked it to create a complicated web app. “The code wasn’t perfect,” Coy notes, “but Fleagle said, ‘As you can see, I just saved myself, like, a lot of time.’ There are dozens of such examples. ChatGPT can even rewrite software into a different programming language.”\r\n\r\nEthan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania\'s of Business, sees great potential as a “learning companion.” He told NPR he has used ChatGPT to help develop a syllabus, lecture, assignment, and grading rubric for MBA students. “It\'s this multiplier of ability, that I think we are not quite getting our heads around, that is absolutely stunning,” he said.\r\n\r\nA multiplier of ability sounds like exactly what we want from new technologies. It may come with the potential to generate fake information and aid and abet cheating, but that’s nothing new, and nothing we can’t work around. Yes, as I’ve written before, higher education must change or die. But responding to the so-called threat that Chatbot software represents is not a concern.', '2023-07-22 09:28:22'),

(13, 'Micheal', 'Chaur', 'Achieving Clear, Radiant Skin: The Best Ways to Attain Your Desired Complexion', 'beauty', 'Having clear and radiant skin is a desire shared by many. A flawless complexion not only boosts our self-confidence but also reflects our overall health and well-being. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving perfect skin, there are several tried-and-tested methods that can significantly improve your skin\'s appearance. In this article, we will explore the best ways to clear the skin, encompassing both internal and external practices for optimal results.\r\n\r\nConsistent Skincare Routine:\r\nEstablishing and sticking to a daily skincare routine is crucial for maintaining clear skin. A basic routine typically includes cleansing, toning, and moisturizing. Choose skincare products that are suitable for your skin type and avoid harsh chemicals that could cause irritation. Additionally, incorporating a gentle exfoliator once or twice a week can help remove dead skin cells and unclog pores, promoting a smoother complexion.\r\n\r\nProtect from Sun Damage:\r\nSun exposure is one of the leading causes of premature aging and skin damage. Make it a habit to wear sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30, even on cloudy days. Sunscreen shields your skin from harmful UV rays, preventing sunspots, wrinkles, and reducing the risk of skin cancer. Don\'t forget to wear protective clothing and seek shade during peak sun hours whenever possible.\r\n\r\nHydration and Nutrition:\r\nBeautiful skin starts from within. Staying hydrated is essential for flushing out toxins and maintaining skin elasticity. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water per day and more if you engage in physically demanding activities or live in a hot climate. Additionally, adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Foods high in antioxidants, such as berries and leafy greens, can help fight free radicals that contribute to skin aging.\r\n\r\nGet Enough Sleep:\r\nSleep is crucial for skin rejuvenation and repair. During deep sleep phases, your body produces collagen, which is vital for maintaining skin elasticity and preventing sagging. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to wake up with a refreshed and radiant complexion.\r\n\r\nStress Management:\r\nChronic stress can wreak havoc on your skin, leading to breakouts and exacerbating skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis. Incorporate stress-reducing activities into your daily routine, such as meditation, yoga, or spending time in nature. Engaging in hobbies, spending time with loved ones, and getting regular exercise can also significantly reduce stress levels.\r\n\r\nAvoid Smoking and Limit Alcohol Consumption:\r\nSmoking damages collagen and elastin, resulting in premature wrinkles and dull-looking skin. Quitting smoking not only improves your overall health but also enhances your skin\'s appearance. Additionally, excessive alcohol consumption can dehydrate the skin and lead to inflammation, exacerbating conditions like acne and rosacea. Moderation is key, and opting for hydrating drinks like water or herbal tea is a better choice for your skin.\r\n\r\nRegular Exercise:\r\nExercise improves blood circulation, which helps deliver essential nutrients and oxygen to your skin cells. Sweating during workouts also aids in eliminating toxins from your body. Find an exercise routine that you enjoy, whether it\'s jogging, dancing, or cycling, and aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nAchieving clear and radiant skin is a combination of internal and external practices. A consistent skincare routine, protection from sun damage, proper hydration, and a balanced diet all play crucial roles in maintaining healthy skin. Equally important is managing stress, getting enough sleep, avoiding harmful habits, and staying active. Remember, achieving the skin you desire takes time and dedication, but with patience and perseverance, you can unlock the secret to a glowing complexion that exudes confidence and beauty.', '2023-07-26 18:00:20');

(14, 'Emmanuel', 'Ekpo', 'Unraveling the Genius: The Art of Pablo Picasso', 'art_design', 'Pablo Picasso, the Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, and one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, left an indelible mark on the world of art. His innovative and prolific career spanned over seven decades, during which he co-founded the Cubist movement, redefined the artistic landscape, and produced an astonishing number of masterpieces. Picasso\'s art is characterized by its unique style, groundbreaking techniques, and profound exploration of the human condition. This article delves into the life and art of the legendary Pablo Picasso, exploring his various periods and highlighting his lasting impact on the art world.\r\n\r\nEarly Life and Influences\r\n\r\nPablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Martyr Patricio Clito Ruíz y Picasso, known simply as Pablo Picasso, was born on October 25, 1881, in Malaga, Spain. His father was an art teacher, which meant that Picasso\'s artistic talent was nurtured from a very young age. By the age of seven, he was already receiving formal art training, and his exceptional skills were apparent.\r\n\r\nPicasso\'s early works were heavily influenced by the Spanish masters, such as Diego Velázquez and Francisco Goya, and he also drew inspiration from African and Iberian art. These influences would later play a significant role in shaping his unique style.\r\n\r\nThe Blue and Rose Periods\r\n\r\nIn his early twenties, Picasso experienced periods of profound personal and artistic transformation. The Blue Period (1901-1904) was marked by melancholic and monochromatic paintings, reflecting themes of poverty, loneliness, and despair. During this period, Picasso used predominantly shades of blue, capturing the emotional turmoil of his subjects.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Blue Period came the Rose Period (1904-1906), characterized by warmer colors and a shift towards circus-themed subjects and harlequins. Picasso\'s art during this phase demonstrated a more hopeful and light-hearted perspective, symbolizing a shift in his personal life as well.\r\n\r\nThe Cubist Revolution\r\n\r\nAround 1907, Picasso, together with Georges Braque, pioneered the Cubist movement, a radical departure from traditional artistic representation. Cubism sought to deconstruct reality into geometric shapes, allowing artists to depict multiple perspectives simultaneously. Picasso\'s groundbreaking painting &quot;Les Demoiselles d\'Avignon&quot; (1907) is often regarded as the starting point of Cubism, as it challenged conventional notions of perspective, form, and composition.\r\n\r\nIn the Analytic Cubism phase that followed, Picasso and Braque delved deeper into this style, using monochromatic tones and fragmented shapes to explore the essence of the subjects they depicted. Later, Synthetic Cubism emerged, incorporating collage elements into their works, breaking down the boundaries between painting and sculpture.\r\n\r\nGuernica and Political Activism\r\n\r\nOne of Picasso\'s most famous and politically charged works is &quot;Guernica&quot; (1937). This large-scale mural-sized painting was a response to the bombing of the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. Picasso\'s powerful portrayal of suffering and horror transcended the specific event, becoming an enduring symbol of the devastation of war and the horrors of fascism. &quot;Guernica&quot; remains a testament to the artist\'s social consciousness and his ability to communicate complex emotions through his art.\r\n\r\nLater Years and Legacy\r\n\r\nIn his later years, Picasso\'s art continued to evolve, as he explored new techniques and mediums such as ceramics and sculpture. He also co-founded the French art movement &quot;Surrealism,&quot; collaborating with other prominent artists of the time.\r\n\r\nPicasso\'s artistic legacy is immense, leaving an enduring impact on modern art and inspiring countless artists worldwide. His ability to traverse different styles, combined with his relentless creativity, has ensured his place as a master of art history. His works can be found in prestigious museums and private collections globally, and they continue to captivate audiences and art enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nPablo Picasso\'s art is a testament to the boundless nature of human creativity. His groundbreaking contributions to Cubism, his politically charged works, and his exceptional ability to adapt and reinvent his artistic style have made him an immortal figure in the history of art. Picasso\'s work remains an enduring source of inspiration and a reminder of the power of art to express the depth and complexity of the human experience. As we continue to explore the art world, Picasso\'s genius will undoubtedly continue to fascinate and captivate generations to come.', '2023-07-26 18:46:38');
